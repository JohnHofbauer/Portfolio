    description:
      "I learned about different techniques and concepts in computer graphics. These include shading methods such as Gouraud shading and Phong shading, texture mapping, anti-aliasing methods, hidden surface removal using Z-buffering, and ray tracing. I also gained knowledge about spatial data structures for accelerating ray tracing, the Phong illumination model in ray tracing, and the importance of light, color, and human vision in computer graphics. Additionally, covered topics such as texture synthesis, scientific visualization, and animation principles.",

    title: "Computer Vision",
    description:
      "I explored computer vision and its aim to provide computers with human-level perception. By employing math and perception pipelines, we determine what to focus on and what we can understand through image features and semantic segmentation. While computers excel at certain tasks, humans still outperform them in more complex aspects, but significant advancements have been made in the field, reshaping our perception of difficulty.",

    description:
      "In September of 2018, I had the opportunity to participate in a local Hackathon event at Downingtown Stem Academy, where my team and I engaged in the end-to-end design, programming, and demonstration of innovative solutions aimed at tackling real-world issues. This experience ignited my enthusiasm towards coding creative problem-solving ideas that are pivotal to resolving the challenges of today; and when I realized my passion for Engineering. After winning some prototyping breadboards my interests exploded, leading me to attend two Hackathons at Penn State.",
