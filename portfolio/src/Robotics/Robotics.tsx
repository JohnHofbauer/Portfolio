              All work was split into tasks among the group members and the
              steps were well documented in our Engineering notebook. This
              helped to create a professional environment where no single person
              was reworking or 'reinventing the wheel' and this allowed me to
              create a distance indicator using an Arduino. This also allowed
              the opportunity to interface Arduino software directly with the
              hardware.

              Every day is a new life experience that I can add to my
              'swiss-army-knife' of ideas as I progress further, learning new
              procedures and exercising my rhetoric. I am confident this webpage
              will document the journey.
